		<h1>What is Telekinesis?</h1>
		<p>Telekinesis is the ability to move objects with your mind. But There are also several types of telekinetic powers such as ;precognition (knowing future events before they happened);pyrokinesis (creating fire with the mind) telepathy (describing things at a remote location). The idea of moving things with mind power has intrigued people for centuries. Although in the late 1800s it has been seen as an ability that could be scientifically demonstrated. This occurred during the heyday of early spiritualism, when psychics claimed to contact the dead during seances. Objects would suddenly and mysteriously start to move, float, or fly by across the room, while seemingly being untouched by human hands.</p><a href="http://www.livescience.com/28119-telekinesis.html"></a> 
		<h2>How I got my powers</h2>
		<p>I discovered this power when I was 10 years of age. How I found out about this power was when I was eating dinner, I picked up my fork then all of a sudden my fork started to bend. At first, I was speechless didn't know what just happened. Then I thought to my self maybe I've had superpowers hidden inside me ever since I was brought into this world. After dinner, I then went into the kitchen to test out my new power, going to grab a spoon out of the kitchen drawer I procceeded to try to bend the spoon with my mind and to my amazement it worked. I bent that spoon back until it touched my finger where I was holding the spoon. Knowing the powers that I had I decided to put my powers to another test by seeing if I could pick up an object. By placing one of my mothers drinking glasses on the kitchen counter I then procceeded to try to lift the glass and it worked lifting it then placing it back down. "Maybe I should show my mom my ability" I thought but being a kid I decided to hide it from her until the time was right.</p>
		<h3>What I do with my power</h3>
		<p>Now knowing that I possessed the power of telekinesis I decided to have a little fun with it. First of all when it came to watching Tv I would change channels with my mind by just mind pressing the buttons. It just started with me using my power for just the small stuff. But when it came to things like chores for example(cleaning, laundry and even showering) that's when I really started to take advantage. For now, it is really being used as a way to make my life easier for the good of it.
